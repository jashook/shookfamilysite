STATION CREEK, TEXAS. The community of Station Creek, named for the nearby stream, was on Farm Road 107 fifteen miles southeast of Gatesville 
in eastern Coryell County. A post office was established there in 1855 with Jouett Harbert Davenport as postmaster. A Methodist church organized 
at Station Creek in the same year was said to be the first Methodist church in Coryell County. In the late 1860s or early 1870s the post office was 
moved to Eagle Springs, two miles southeast of the Station Creek community. The school at Station Creek, called the Alexander school because of its 
location in John N. Alexander's pasture, had forty students and one teacher in 1904. Only the cemetery marked the community on county highway maps 
in 2000.

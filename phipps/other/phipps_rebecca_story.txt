
Rebecca PHIPPS was born about 1805 in Louisiana. She died in 1842 in Harris County, Texas. In 1803, 
the United States and France entered into the Louisiana Purchase. Soon after, a border war between Spain 
and the United States erupted over the Texas/Louisiana border. It is possible that parts of Louisiana were 
considered part of Texas at this time, and visa versa.

After the death of her first husband, Rebecca married George Comstock-White (born 9-30-1800 in Lafayette, Louisiana). 
They are both listed as ancestors by the Daughters of the Republic of Texas. George served in a number of early Texas 
Republic grand juries, including one assembled to develop laws curbing the custom of duelling in 1838. Rebecca and George 
had a son, James Taylor Phipps-White b: 4 AUG 1835 in Harrisburg, Harris County, Texas. George died in February 1850.

George White owned the area of South Houston known as the Elena Fruit and Cotton Farms, a district just south of Houston's 
Cedar Bayou Road extending to and partially including the Port of Houston.

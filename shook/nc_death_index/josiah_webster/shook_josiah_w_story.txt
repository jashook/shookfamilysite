According to a family legend, Josaih Shook came to Texas with his mother and his brother Robert 
but there is no substantiating evidence that his mother ever came to Texas.

In the 1850 census, a Christian Rumble from Germany was living with the family.

In 1886, Josiah sold 7200 acres of land in the Humble oil field to Judge Masterson at sixty-five cents per acre. 
His wife did not sign the deed as it was all the land they had at that time. Papers regarding this sale may be in 
the Judge Harris Masterson Collection held at Rice University's Fondren Libray's Woodson Research Center.

There was a Josiah Shook listed as the postmaster of Bastrop County, no date given, uncertain if there is any relation.

There is no marker on his grave; according to Beatrice Carmichael, the gravesite is to the left of the gate as you enter the old cemetery.

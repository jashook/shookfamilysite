Four acres of land were donated for Union Cemetery by early settlers Joseph Marcus Jackson and 
his wife Eleanor Thompson Jackson. Named Union Cemetery because it serves all of the communities 
around Durango, the earliest recorded burial was that of infant Mary Braswell in 1836. Among the 
more than 800 burials are many of the area's pioneer settlers and their descendants, and veterans 
from the Civil War, World War I, World War II, and the Korean War. The cemetery is maintained by 
an association established in 1977, and continues to serve this area of Falls County.

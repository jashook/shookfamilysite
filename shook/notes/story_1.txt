I don't have alot of information on the Shook, except that Josiah died 11-5-1889 at the age of 81, Amanda is list ad
the daughter of Rebecca Phipps and step-father is George White. Amanda died at 913 South 10th in Waco, Texas. The only
child that I knew of for this union was to be Saphronia Carolyn born 05-19-1851. She married Michael E. Norris in Montgomerty County
on 03-18-1869. They had 4 children and the oldest is my gg-grandmother, Frances E Norris/Hines. According to my dad's half-sister,
Peter Shook and his brother started to American from Holand(?). Stop in France where he meet Saphronia________ and married prior
to boarding ship. Stayed in the Penn. area for awhile prior to starting south and ended in the Houston area. Have been told they
were ship builders by trade. From there the family stories says that gg-grandmother has been in the present of Sam Houston
during the fight for independance(Texas). I sure would like to visit with you either via phone of e-mail and exchange other
information. Please e-mail me at worldoftravel@msn.co. or call 1-972-771-3579. Frances Stewart Reynolds

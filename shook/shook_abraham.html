<p>Abraham's birth date of 03-FEB-1764 and death date ca. MAR-1832 is from a story on Ancestry.com.
This story enumerates the children, which ties Josiah Webster &quot;Joe&quot; Shook to this Abraham.</p>

<h1>Notes 1</h1>

<p>Abraham was probably alive in 1836, as Jacob leaves him one dollar in his will. However, the person who transcribed the will says he died in 1832.</p>

<h1>Notes 2</h1>

<p>One of the best web sites about Shook History is <a href="http://www.shookhistory.org/main_site">http://www.shookhistory.org</a>.</p>

<p>I have thought for a long time that Josiah Shook was the son of Abraham Shook. (There were hints on the web, but no real proof.) However, when 
William L Shook (w.l.shook@verizon.net) put Abraham's will on the web recently (March 4, 2010) that was a real treasure. Abraham's will lists the family 
members! In addition, the Horowitz Family citation has some credibility because the children are listed exactly in the same order as Abraham's will 
(which is a state document in the North Carolina archives.) Unfortunately (or fortunately) the Horowitz Family citation has Josiah Shook's birth date 
as ~1816 whereas other citations (?) have ~1808. Regardless, the will definitelty ties Josiah Shook as the son of Abraham Shook and that ties all of 
the research I've done to Abraham.</p>

<p>At this time, the real gap is tying Abraham to Johanne Jacob Shook. Several citations on the web have Abraham's date of death during the War of 1812. 
Yet Abraham's will ties this Abraham to Josiah and a death date ca. January 10, 1832 (or later) - certainly not the War of 1812. If the War citations are 
correct that means Abraham is not Jacob's son; however, there is only one Abraham Shook in the census records in that period. So the odds mean the War 
citations are probably incorrect.</p>

<p>War of 1812 Service Records shows Abraham in 2 Reg't Mounted Gunmen Williamson's), Tennessee Volunteers (good indication this in not Josiah's father).</p>

<h1>Notes 3</h1>

<p>Wlima Hicks Simpson ties the Tennessee / War of 1812 Abraham to Jacob Shook. My first reaction was that is incorrect, but looking at one of the Ancestry.com
family trees where the guy had Abraham's will transcribed, he had Abraham tied to Johanne George Shook (Jacob's father). That's a possibility, making Abraham Jacob's
brother (not son). So this is still an area of confusion for me.</p>

<h1>Notes 4</h1>

<p>One citation on Abraham's death (as child of George) has his death as 04-AUG-1842 in Iredell County, North Carolina (very similar to my research)</p>

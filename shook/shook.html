<p>I started building this web site as an aide to document my own Shook family, which
is almost entirely in Texas. As I researched my family, I began documenting other Shook
families (mainly to separate my ancestors from others). After a while, my research on other
Shook family lines became just as enjoyable. Currently, about 60% of my research focuses
on the Johannes Schuck (Shook) family; first starting in Texas, and then working back to
North Carolina and Pennsylvania. The other 40% of my research relates to other Shook families
living in Texas and their ancestors branching back to their roots. Hence, my research
has steered lately toward to the Midwest (Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio), Tennessee, and other
parts of the Deep South (Mississippi and Alabama).</p>

<h1>Shook Family Lines</h1>

<p>The index at the right lists all the Shook individuals I have profiled.</p>

<p>Within each profile, individuals are indexed within a family line as follows:
<a href="http://shookfamily.org/shook/shook_abraham_ii.html">Abraham Shook (ii)</a>,
<a href="http://shookfamily.org/shook/shook_hermanus.html">Hermanus Shook</a>,
<a href="http://shookfamily.org/shook/shook_johannes.html">Johannes Shook (Schuck)</a>,
<a href="http://shookfamily.org/shook/shook_john_oliver_sr.html">John Oliver Shook, Sr.</a>,
<a href="http://shookfamily.org/shook/shook_saul_francis.html">Saul Francis Shook</a>,
<a href="http://shookfamily.org/shook/shook_william_iv.html">William Shook (iv)</a>,
or within a group of individuals not associated with a family line yet. The Johannes Schuck
(Shook) family line is about 60% of my research, the Hermanus Shook family line is about
20%, and everyone else is also about 20%.</p>

<p>Come back to this page for the list of all Shook individuals.</p>

<h1>The Johannes Schuck (Shook) Family</h1>

<h2>Josiah Webster Shook</h2>

<p>My research in Shook family genealogy started with my Texas Shook Family
(Josiah) and how we relate (or not) to Jacob Shook (Josiah's grandfather). In that respect,
my paternal Shook tree is the following:
<a href="http://shookfamily.org/shook/shook_jan_joseph_jr.html">Jan Joseph Shook, Jr.</a>-&gt;
<a href="http://shookfamily.org/shook/shook_jan_joseph_sr.html">Jan Joseph Shook, Sr.</a>-&gt;
<a href="http://shookfamily.org/shook/shook_jesse_earl_sr.html">Jesse Earl Shook, Sr.</a>-&gt;
<a href="http://shookfamily.org/shook/shook_joseph_webster_sr.html">Joseph Webster Shook, Sr.</a>-&gt;
<a href="http://shookfamily.org/shook/shook_theodrick.html">Theodrick Shook</a>-&gt;
<a href="http://shookfamily.org/shook/shook_josiah_webster.html">Josiah Webster Shook</a>-&gt;
<a href="http://shookfamily.org/shook/shook_abraham.html">Abraham Shook</a>-&gt;
<a href="http://shookfamily.org/shook/shook_johanne_jacob.html">Johanne Jacob Shook</a>-&gt;
<a href="http://shookfamily.org/shook/shook_johanne_hans_george.html">Johanne Hans George Schuck (Shook)</a>-&gt;
<a href="http://shookfamily.org/shook/shook_johannes.html">Johannes Schuck (Shook)</a>. This
may be of little interest to you, but at least you can see how the research originated and the
direction of progress.</p>

<p>Josiah Webster Shook was born in North Carolina and immigrated to Texas in the late
1830's. In his will, Abraham Shook (North Carolina) recorded Josiah as his son. So far in
my research, I have not been able to find another Josiah Shook. That ties Josiah to that
Abraham, defining the Josiah Webster Shook line from Texas to North Carolina. After that,
things get a bit speculative. If you are a descendent of Josiah Webster Shook, we are almost
certainly related. If you are a descendent of Abraham Shook, we are nearly certainly related.
If you are a descendent of Johanne Jacob Shook, we are related but the degree of relationship
is perhaps off by one or two degrees (depending on if Abraham was the son of Johanne Jacob
Shook or the uncle of Johanne Jacob Shook).</p>

<h2>Abraham Shook</h2>

<p>Census records record Josiah Webster Shook as born in North Caroline. Therefore,
his father, Abraham, was living in North Carolina ca. 1808, and probably was born there.</p>

<p>For a long time, I have assumed that Josiah Webster Shook was the grandson of Johanne
Jacob Shook. The longer I research, though, the less certain I am of this assumption. For
one thing, Jacob would have been 15 years old when Josiah's father, Abraham, was born (assuming
all the birth dates are correct, which is not necessarily a good assumption either).</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Abraham is a fairly common name, and Abraham's father is not clear.
<a href="http://shookfamily.org/shook/shook_johanne_jacob.html">Johanne Jacob Shook</a>,
one of the Shook family's best documented individuals, had a son named Abraham. I have
been to Jacob's house twice and visited with a caretaker. While Jacob and many of his
children are well documented, Abraham is recorded as little more than the son of Jacob.</p>

<p>So far I have found three Abraham Shooks that may relate to someone in North Carolina:
<a href="http://shookfamily.org/shook/shook_abraham.html">Abraham Shook</a>,
<a href="http://shookfamily.org/shook/shook_abraham_ii.html">Abraham Shook (ii)</a>, and
<a href="http://shookfamily.org/shook/shook_abraham_iii.html">Abraham Shook (iii)</a>. Like
many other researchers, I have assumed that &quot;my&quot; Abraham Shook is the son of Johanne
Jacob Shook (it's more fun to research, and Jacob is a very colorful character).</p>

<h2>Johanne Jacob Shook</h2>

<p>Whether my family line (or yours) directly descends from Johanne Jacob Shook, he was a
wonderful character and a great study in Shook history. I urge you to read <i>Greater Than The Mountains Was He</i> by
Wilma Hicks Simpson. Clicking on the book cover to the right takes you to Amazon.com (I do not
make a commission on any purchases). Wilma gives a good biography of Johanne Jacob Shook and how
his ancestors arrived in Pennsylvania from Germany, how his descendents immigrated to North Carolina,
and how the [Jacob] Shook family became so immersed in Methodism.</p>

<p>While Wilma's research is good, it is not bullet proof. Wilma, for example, identifies
<a href="http://shookfamily.org/shook/shook_abraham_ii.html">Abraham Shook (ii)</a> as the son
of Jacob Shook without any proof to back up that claim. As mentioned above, there are several
Abraham Shook candidates for the son of Jacob. I have reviewed the genealogy records of the
Daughters of the American Revolution (which is the caretaker of the [Jacob] Shook house / museum),
and their notes are simply Abraham Shook son of Jacob. Their records do not have any other detail
to link any of the Abraham Shook candidates I have documented in this web site. I'm not declaring
Wilma is wrong. Only that her choice of Abraham Shook (ii) is unsubstantiated. At this point in
my research, my Abraham connection to Jacob Shook is just as reasonable as any one else's research,
and any help I get in solving this mystery will be well appreciated!</p>

<h2>Texas History</h2>

<p>Wilma Hicks Simpson's book <i>Greater Than The Mountains Was He</i> provides a good overview
of the Shook family in American history. My focus on Josiah Webster Shook and his Shook family in
Texas has started putting together a descent look into Texas history (at least for our Shook families).
After documenting everything I could about the Josiah Webster Shook family, I began to systematically
document Shook individuals that were not always related to Josiah. For example, I have researched most
(but not all of) the Texas Death Certificates related to Shook deaths. In doing this, I have linked some
of my relatives in a way that was just not possible otherwise - especially for females that change their
maiden name. Similarly, I have been documenting the Texas / Shook graves in findagrave.com. This approach
is starting to build a fairly robust profile of the different Shook families in Texas. As time has progressed,
this web site have started to shift from my own personal family to all the Shook families in Texas and,
as a result, where the immigrated from. The first maternal Shook family members arrived in Texas in the
1820s with the paternal side arriving in the 1830s. I am (slowly) trying to create a good history of each
decade in each section highlighted below.</p>

<h1>Other Shook Families</h1>

<p>As mentioned above, most of the research I am doing on my Shook family is maturing. So I have started
researching other Shook families in Texas - related or not. In general, I'm rather shocked at how many of us
are related. Often, I'll start documenting a Shook (often randomly from a cemetery or death certificate) only
to find out that four or five generations ago we share an ancestor. In that regard, I have enjoyed documenting
many different Shook families. Hopefully it is helpful to you. Check back often, as I update this website
regularly (usually about once every month or two).</p>
